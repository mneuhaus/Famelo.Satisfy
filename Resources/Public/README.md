# Bootstrap Boilerplate

This is an composition of the best things of [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) for Design, [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) for Structure and [Iconic for Bootstrap](https://github.com/jasny/bootstrap/tree/2.0-icons) for flexible icons.

# Usage

To keep Bootstrap easily updatetable it is located in the subfolder lib and shouldn't be modified. Instead you can use the files in css to change the things needed.
